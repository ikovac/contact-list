Example of linked lists in Rust ðŸ¦€.

My first Rust program.
Implementing linked lists in Rust was a very challenging experience especially for a newbie like me who has just started to learn Rust.
Doing it I learned a lot of new concepts which are related to Rust such as:
- ownership and lifetimes
- smart pointers
- unmutable and mutable borrows
- iterators
- traits
- custom types

and soo much more..
